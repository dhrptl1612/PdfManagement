## üîç Project Overview

The PDF Management & Collaboration System is designed to provide a secure and user-friendly platform for managing PDF documents with collaborative features. The system consists of a FastAPI backend and a React frontend, with MongoDB as the database. PDFs can be stored directly in MongoDB using GridFS, enabling efficient retrieval and secure storage.

### Core Capabilities

- User authentication and profile management
- PDF upload, viewing, and management
- PDF sharing via email invitations or shareable links
- Real-time commenting system for collaboration
- Secure access controls to ensure document privacy
- Responsive design that works across various devices

## üíª Technology Stack

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: High-performance Python web framework
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database with GridFS for PDF storage
- **PyJWT**: Python library for JSON Web Tokens (authentication)
- **Python 3.9+**: Primary programming language for backend

### Frontend
- **React 19**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **React Router**: Page navigation and routing
- **Material UI**: Component library for consistent design
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API requests

### Development Tools
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and code collaboration
- **Vercel**: Frontend deployment platform
- **Docker**: Containerization (optional for local development)

### Data Flow
1. User authenticates through React frontend
2. Frontend makes API calls to FastAPI backend
3. Backend validates requests and interacts with MongoDB
4. MongoDB stores user data, PDF files (via GridFS), and comments
5. Backend returns responses to frontend
6. Frontend updates UI based on response data

Section 6: User Journey

## üë£ User Journey

### First-time User
1. Registers an account with name, email, and password
2. Arrives at empty dashboard
3. Uploads first PDF document
4. Views the PDF in the built-in viewer
5. Adds comments to the PDF
6. Shares the PDF with collaborators via email or link

### Returning User
1. Logs in to access dashboard
2. Sees list of owned and shared PDFs
3. Searches for specific documents
4. Opens a PDF to view or add comments
5. Manages sharing permissions or deletes own PDFs

### Invited User (via Link)
1. Clicks on shared PDF link
2. Views PDF without needing an account
3. Has read-only access to the document

### Collaborative Workflow
1. Owner uploads PDF and shares with team
2. Team members add comments on specific areas
3. Owner reviews comments and makes revisions
4. Updated version can be uploaded for further review
